You can expand or narrow the scope of your query by including several data columns as part of your search condition.
For examples, you might want to:
Search for employees who either have worked more than five years at the company or who hold certain jobs.
Search for a book that is both published by a specific publisher and pertains to cooking.
To create a query that searches for values in either of two (or more) columns, you specify an OR
condition. To create a query that must meet all conditions in two (or more) columns, you specify an AND condition.
